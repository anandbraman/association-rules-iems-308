Association Rules Homework for IEMS 308

## File Descriptions
`eda_and_cleaning.ipynb` is the notebook in which I did some eda and all cleaning. This was simplified and translated into the
`cleaning_script.py`. The two required files for `cleaning_script.py` are `strinfo.csv` and `trnsact.csv`. Both should be stored in a data folder. 
<br>
`association_rules.ipynb` and `association_rules.py` use the data created by `cleaning_script.py`. `association_rules.ipynb` 
also uses `skstinfo.csv` and `strinfo.csv`.

Enjoy!
